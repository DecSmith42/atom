    /// Gets or sets the working directory for the .NET CLI command execution.
    /// </summary>
    /// <value>
    /// The path to the directory where the command should be executed, or <c>null</c> to use
    /// the current application's working directory. Relative paths are resolved relative to
    /// the current working directory.
    /// </value>
    /// <remarks>
    /// When specified, this directory becomes the current working directory for the child process,
    /// affecting relative path resolution and file operations within the executed command.
    /// The directory must exist when the process is started, or the execution will fail.

    /// Gets or sets the log level for messages indicating the invocation of the .NET CLI command.
    /// </summary>
    /// <value>
    /// The <see cref="LogLevel" /> used when logging the command start information,
    /// including the executable name, arguments, and working directory. Defaults to <see cref="LogLevel.Information" />.
    /// </value>
    /// <remarks>
    /// This property controls the visibility of command invocation logging. Setting this to a higher level
    /// (e.g., <see cref="LogLevel.Debug" />) reduces log verbosity in production scenarios, while lower levels
    /// (e.g., <see cref="LogLevel.Trace" />) provide more detailed execution tracking.
    /// </remarks>

    /// var options = new DotnetCliOptions { InvocationLogLevel = LogLevel.Debug };

    /// </summary>
    /// <value>
    /// The <see cref="LogLevel" /> used when logging each line of standard output from the command.
    /// Defaults to <see cref="LogLevel.Debug" />.

    /// <remarks>
    /// This property controls how standard output from the .NET CLI command is logged. Debug level is

    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>
    /// When set to <c>false</c> (the default), any non-zero exit code from the executed command

    /// <para>
    /// When set to <c>true</c>, the command execution completes normally regardless of the exit code,

    /// (e.g., remove ANSI color codes). Keep the transformation fast and side-effect free; it may be
