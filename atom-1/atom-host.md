# Atom Host

The `AtomHost` class is the entry point for running any Atom-based application. It provides static methods to set up and execute your build definition, handling all the underlying infrastructure like dependency injection, configuration loading, and logging.

### GenerateEntryPoint

Often, you won't even need to write the application entry point yourself.

By applying the `[GenerateEntryPoint]` attribute to your main build definition class, Atom will automatically generate a `<file>.g.cs` that calls `AtomHost.Run<YourBuildDefinition>(args)` for you.

```csharp
// In your build definition project (e.g., Build.cs)
[BuildDefinition]
[GenerateEntryPoint] // This attribute tells Atom to generate Program.cs
public partial class MyBuild : BuildDefinition
{
    // ... your build definition ...
}
```

The following will be generated:

```csharp
// <auto-generated/>

DecSm.Atom.Hosting.AtomHost.Run<MyBuild>(args);
```

### AtomHost

The `AtomHost` class simplifies the process of getting your Atom build up and running. You typically interact with it through its `Run` method, which takes your build definition as a type parameter.

#### Run

If you already have a `Program.cs` file, you can simply add the following to create and run atom in one line:

```csharp
AtomHost.Run<MyBuildDefinition>(args);
```

#### CreateHostBuilder

```csharp
var builder = AtomHost.CreateAtomBuilder<MyBuildDefinition>(args);

// Do some custom setup with the HostBuilder here

var host = builder.Build();

// Do more custom setup with the Host here

host.UseAtom();

// Or here

host.Run();
```
