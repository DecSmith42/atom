# Atom

#### What is Atom?

Atom is a C# based task and build automation framework designed to be flexible and extensible. It helps automate development workflows by defining and executing build tasks.

Heavily inspired by the likes of [NUKE](https://nuke.build/), Atom aims to provide a flexible, extensible framework for defining and executing build tasks.

It leverages .NET and provides a comprehensive set of features for automating your development workflow.
