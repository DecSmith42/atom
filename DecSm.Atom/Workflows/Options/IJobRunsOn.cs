/// <remarks>
///     This interface is typically implemented by specific workflow definitions (e.g., for GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps).
///     It provides common constants for operating system tags like <see cref="WindowsLatestTag" />, <see cref="UbuntuLatestTag" />, and
///     <see cref="MacOsLatestTag" />.
///     The actual runner is determined by the <see cref="JobRunsOn" /> property, which is often configured externally.
///     It can be used in build matrices to run jobs across multiple environments.
