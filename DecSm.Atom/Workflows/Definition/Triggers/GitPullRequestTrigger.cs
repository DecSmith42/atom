///     Represents a workflow trigger that activates on Git pull request events.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     This trigger provides fine-grained control over activation conditions through branch patterns,
///     file path filters, and pull request event types.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
///     <code>
/// // Trigger on pull requests into the main branch
/// var mainPrTrigger = GitPullRequestTrigger.IntoMain;
/// 
/// // Trigger on pull requests that modify files in the 'src' directory
/// var srcPrTrigger = new GitPullRequestTrigger
/// {
///     IncludedPaths = ["src/**"]
/// };
///     </code>
