///     Represents a workflow trigger that activates when code is pushed to a Git repository.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     This trigger supports filtering by branches, file paths, and tags to control workflow execution.
///     When filter lists are empty, no filtering is applied for that category.
/// </remarks>
/// <example>
///     <code>
/// // Trigger on pushes to the main branch only
/// var mainTrigger = GitPushTrigger.ToMain;
///
/// // Trigger on pushes to any branch, excluding documentation changes
/// var featureTrigger = new GitPushTrigger
/// {
///     ExcludedPaths = ["docs/**", "*.md"]
/// };
///     </code>
